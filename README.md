# Project Title

Refactoring code for Horiseon

## Description

For this project, I had to go through the code for a fictional SEO service called "Horiseon", and clean it up; which included using semantic elements to section the webpage, deleting re-used CSS code and compiling them into one rule-set, making sure links worked, and making sure headers were organized in a sequential order.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To access this project, you would want to go in Git Bash (or any other terminal you use), pull all files within the "gt-atl-fsf-ft-08-2020-u-c" repo, go to the "02-Homework" folder within "01-HTML-Git-CSS", go inside the "Develop" folder, and copy both the "index.html" and the "assets" folder to your own repo.

### Executing program

Open HTML file in a browser to view how it looks visually and to see how it operates.
